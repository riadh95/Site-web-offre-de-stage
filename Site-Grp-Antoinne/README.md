# online_internship_system
A website that lets you find and apply internships online. php based project

Project AIM: 
     Design and develop a web application (in PHP), which will be an internship portal similar to that of Internshala, but on a much smaller scale.

The application will have 2 kinds of users, student and employer.
After registering, the employer should be able to post internships, with bare minimum details. Internship posting should be restricted only to an employer and a student as well as a non registered user, should not be allowed.
There should be a page which should display all the internships being posted on the application. This page should be accessible to everyone irrespective of whether the user is even logged in.
A student should be able to apply to any internship he may want. If the student has already applied for an internship, he should be restricted from applying again. If the user is not logged in, it should redirect to the login page. And if the user is logged in as an employer, he should not be allowed to apply.
The employer should be able to see all the application he has received for his internships.
Other features
Users(employee/student) can view and modify their profile after successful login.
Employer can view and edit internships created by him, via employee dashboard after successful login.
Student can Opt out of applied internship via student dashboard after successful login.
A student can view his list of applied internships via dashboard after successful login.
Student/employee dashboard is visible after successful login.
Dashboards contain some insights regarding his account and the actions he can take.
The application is responsive(bootstrap v4.1.1 is used) and so it looks good on mobile also.
